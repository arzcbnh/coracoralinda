# Coracoralinda

Coracoralinda is a fortune program aimed at Generation Z, and includes fortunes that are  self-deprecating, potential Olivia Rodrigo lyrics, and some shower thoughts from Tumblr.

The name Coracoralinda is inspired by my friend and aspiring writer Coral, whose I've developed this program for and has written a few of the fortunes in it, and the Brazilian poet Cora Coralina.

## Usage

To display a random fortune:

```
$ coracoralinda
```
You can use it in a shell or system init, for example.

## Installation

After downloading the source code, you need to extract the program, compile it and install with make. In the example, v0.2.1-alpha is installed. You may need to run the installation step as superuser.

```
$ tar xf coracoralinda-0.2.1-alpha.tar.gz && cd coracoralinda-0.2.1-alpha
$ make
$ make install
```

## Contributions

Neither code nor fortune contributions are being accepted as of now.
